Old saves are compatible, but there will be some error logs due to minor issues with the old raws.  These logs can be ignored, but old saves will still experience problems like blank seed names.\r\n\r\nMajor bug fixes\r\n\r\n    * Fixed problem causing dwarves to sometimes fail to attack monsters/invaders\r\n    * Stopped active blocks/parries from rarely freezing adv mode\r\n    * Stopped certain situations where you could be stuck in the air above certain tiles\r\n    * Fixed a few problems with necromancers attacking (and generally being killed by) their zombies\r\n    * Stopped crash from moving/centering squad menu going out of bounds\r\n    * Fixed crash involving squads and minimap\r\n    * Fixed unretire crash that generally triggered when caravan arrived\r\n    * Stopped dwarf from stressing out over the same wound forever\r\n    * Stopped certain inaccessible jobs from blocking lower priority ones\r\n\r\nOther bug fixes/tweaks\r\n\r\n    * Allowed embarks with x/y dim 1\r\n    * Made removal of trees check building/bridge/machine stability\r\n    * Stopped worker chaining to next construction job from choosing suspended one\r\n    * Tentatively fixed text mode error on OSX (lethosor)\r\n    * Tentatively fixed broken sound on some linuxes (Baughn)\r\n    * Fixed problem with water disappearing when it crosses the z=0 boundary\r\n    * Made certain old civilian weapon assignments clear over time\r\n    * Made t/q building selector respect stockpile shapes when looking for closest one\r\n    * Fixed error with underground pops in small forts not appearing\r\n    * Stopped mood jobs from going outside of burrows\r\n    * Capped various combat skill gains per action (Urist Da Vinci)\r\n    * Stopped \"fighting\" skill from increasing from trap/projectile attacks\r\n    * Stopped random creature proboscis from sometimes messing up poison attacks\r\n    * Fixed key display issue in bindings screen (lethosor)\r\n    * Fixed problem with display of kill order status\r\n    * Made geld indicator appear for pets on animal screen properly\r\n    * Fixed display problem with agreement conclusion dates\r\n    * Added error logs for missing materials set to defaults, fixed various raws\r\n    * Stopped announcement screen date from overrunning title depending on window size\r\n    * Differentiated two pain readouts on health screen\r\n    * Fixed a few empty announcement errors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease notes for 0.40.23 (December 21, 2014):\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nI've sorted out the \"camp forever\" errorlog message many of you have probably seen. Once dwarf/adventure mode began, there was a misflagging that caused various armies to lose their way. It doesn't directly affect invaders camping between marches, but armies lost to the bug (on their way home, for instance, or attacking villages) wouldn't be available for invasions later. This doesn't affect refugee groups that have nowhere to go... they still hang out and sleep all day.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor bug fixes \r\n\r\n    * Multi-item jobs like artifact moods, forging breastplates and smelting pig iron should work now\r\n\r\nOther bug fixes/tweaks\r\n\r\n    * Made toggle marker behave like toggle engraving mouse-wise\r\n\r\n******************************************************\r\n\r\nRelease notes for 0.40.22 (December 19, 2014):\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis fixes some large and small problems with yesterday's release. Save corruption was quite possible, so upgrading is important! You can still bring your old saves from 0.40.03+ into this new version. \r\n\r\n\r\nMajor bug fixes \r\n\r\n    * Made hauling jobs that chain to other hauling jobs respect job postings, instead of causing crashes and other horror\r\n    * Fixed stair/ramp removal\r\n\r\nOther bug fixes/tweaks\r\n\r\n    * Made digging look up/down for continuing jobs\r\n    * Fixed problem with harvest jobs stealing dwarves from each other\r\n\r\n  ******************************************************\r\n\r\nRelease notes for 0.40.21 (December 19, 2014):\r\n-------------  \r\n\r\nHere is the job priorities release. It should work fine with old saves, though existing hauling jobs may need to work themselves out for a bit. Further job prioritization work can be done when we get through the framework for start scenarios, since we'll better understand how dwarves fit into the fortress at that time. \r\n\r\nNew stuff\r\n\r\n    * New job selection process where dwarves choose important tasks with more regularity\r\n    * Very important jobs can remove dwarves from less important jobs\r\n    * Ability to prioritize a job so that it gets done immediately\r\n    * Mining, engraving and other designation jobs can now be prioritized numerically\r\n    * Designation jobs can be placed in a \"marker only\" mode, marker can be removed later to start work\r\n    * Mining jobs can be set to automatically follow veins and clusters\r\n    * Mining designation can be set to only select visible gems or useful stone\r\n\r\nMajor bug fixes \r\n\r\n    * Fixed crash related to armies failing to take over villages\r\n\r\nOther bug fixes/tweaks\r\n\r\n    * Hauling jobs that used to need a held container now allow the dwarf to carry many items without a container\r\n    * Building jobs can swipe items from hauling jobs if the item is not held\r\n    * Wall/floor construction and road construction use new skill-free labor settings\r\n\r\nRelease notes for 0.40.20 (December 18, 2014):\r\n-------------  \r\n\r\nI added some different mining designations -- gems only (in the selected area as usual, unhidden tiles), economically useful only (including gems), and an automated designation that spreads to the same material when a job finishes. This can't be placed on layer-wide walls (so you don't mine out all the chalk in the universe), but it can be placed on walls which are part of large oval clusters (which the dwarf will proceed to mine out entirely), vein walls and small cluster walls. Road and wall/etc. construction jobs use two skill-free labor settings now, since skill didn't matter for constructions anyway.\r\n\r\nLet's see... jobs that are assigned in workshops can swipe items from haul jobs now, provided the hauler doesn't make it to the item before the item is needed. I've also replaced the grab-a-container-and-then-collect-pile-items haul jobs with the ability for dwarves to haul multiple items without a container (as in fruit picking). The piece that's still missing is the use of a wheelbarrow to avoid, for example, dwarves staggering around with tons of bars, but I'm going to put that off since it could be a quagmire. This hauling change only applies to the stockpile container jobs (bin/bag/barrel), since it was the one that caused the most trouble for people and other jobs are more difficult to adapt.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n#   Dependencies\r\n\r\n   Install required packages\r\n\r\n For Debian / Ubuntu\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install default-jre libsdl1.2debian:i386 libsdl-image1.2:i386 libsdl-ttf2.0-0:i386 libglu1-mesa:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386 libopenal1:i386 libjpeg62:i386 git mercurial wget coreutils tar unzip unrar make g++ gcc patch xterm sed python bzip2 qtchooser qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qtscript5-dev qt5-qmake libqt5script5 libqt5scripttools5 libqxt-core0 libqxt-gui0\r\n```\r\n\r\n For Fedora (21)\r\n```\r\nyum install SDL.i686 SDL_image.i686 SDL_ttf.i686 mesa-libGLU.i686 gtk2.i686 zlib.i686 openal-soft.i686 xterm python qt qt-x11 bzip2 xorg-x11-fonts-Type1\r\n```\r\n\r\n  System Requirements\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n* A Java runtime environment for the LNP GUI.\r\n* SDL 1.2, 32-bit\r\n* LibGLU 1, 32-bit\r\n* LibGTK 2.0, 32-bit\r\n* OpenAL 1.2, 32-bit\r\n* LibJPEG 6.2, 32-bit\r\n* Git\r\n* Mercurial (hg)\r\n* Qt5 Development Libraries including qmake\r\n* Python 2.x (for Quickfort)\r\n* The following fairly standard Linux utilities:\r\n  - wget\r\n  - sha1sum\r\n  - sed\r\n  - tar\r\n  - unzip\r\n  - unrar\r\n  - make\r\n  - g++\r\n  - gcc\r\n  - xterm\r\n\r\n Usage\r\n=====\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: ./startlnp\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTested On\r\n=========\r\n* Ubuntu 14.04 \"Trusty Tahr\" - With deps listed above installed..\r\n* Fedora 21/64bit - With deps listed above installed.\r\n\r\nCommon Issues\r\n=============\r\nSee [the WIKI](https://github.com/Lazy-Newb-Pack/Lazy-Newb-Pack-Linux/wiki/Common-Errors).\r\n\r\nCredits & Special Thanks\r\n=============\r\n\r\n * [@andrewd18](https://github.com/andrewd18/) Andrew Dorney made the awesome linux LNP installer script\r\n * [@amfournda](https://github.com/amfournda/) Created a great gentoo fix script included in the pack\r\n * [@beaubouchard](https://github.com/BeauBouchard) Maintains this package and [lazynewbpack.com](http://www.lazynewbpack.com/) website\r\n * [@Captain Duck](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0sBhCMFBvPlF7wG7OH-NFQKMeCQiS8aM) Just all around great guy, watch his Dwarf Fortress Tutorial series and subscribe!\r\n * [@Daveralph](https://github.com/daveralph1234/LazyNewbPack/) continued working on LNP after Dricus \r\n * [@Dricus](https://github.com/Dricus)   Dirk Groot is the creator of the cross platform LNP port\r\n * [@Dwimenor](https://github.com/Dwimenor/) Created a workaround for LNP, as well as providing linux support\r\n * [@fricy](https://github.com/fricy/) Maintains the MacNewbie pack Reborn as well as supporting essential gaphic repo\r\n * [@joelpt](http://www.joelpt.net/quickfort/) Joel Thornton Created Quickfort 2.x\r\n * [@lethosor](https://github.com/lethosor) Works on DFhack, DFwiki, and maintainer of the LNP\r\n * [@LucasUP](https://github.com/LucasUP/) Lucas Paquette made the original windows LNP\r\n * [@miffedmap](https://github.com/miffedmap) Actively perfecting cross distro compatibility  \r\n * [@mifki](https://github.com/mifki) Text Will Be Text dfmultiscroll and webfort\r\n * [@splintermind](https://github.com/splintermind/) Josh, part time wizard works dilligently on Dwarf Therapist\r\n * [@PeridexisErrant](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076.0) Maintains the Windows Package\r\n * [@Pidgeot](https://bitbucket.org/Pidgeot/python-lnp/) Michael is a Founding developer of PyLNP\r\n * [@runrobotrun](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=55025.0) Created Chromafort\r\n * [@Zweistein](http://zweistein.cz/) Created Soundsense, enriching the game with awesome sound packages!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I forgot people, please let me know and I'll include them in the list.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
